/** A mix-in trait which provides Java's basic "try-with-resources" statement.
  *
  * Usage example:
  * {{{
  * import net.java.truecommons3.shed.ResourceLoan_
  * val out: OutputStream = ...
  * loan(new PrintWriter(out)) to { w: PrintWriter => w.println("Hello world!") }
  * }}}
  * In this example, `w.close()` is guaranteed to get called even if the
  * to-function terminates with a [[Throwable]].
  *
  * In general, if the to-function throws a throwable `t1` and the
  * `AutoCloseable.close()` method throws another throwable `t2`, then the
  * throwable `t2` gets added to the throwable `t1` using
  * `t1.addSuppressed(t2)`.
